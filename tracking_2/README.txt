Dear All,

	1. Only RFID.h is already done. Other parts should be done by your background knowledge from former labs.

	2. Make sure the library <MFRC522.h> was already downloaded.

	3. Please refer to the pdf file for wiring.

	4. Feel free to ask TA by email, but please don't message us, we would ignore direct message.

Best,
TAs
