Dear all,

	1. Please check whether your python version is at least 3.5, some trouble may occur if using 2.7

	2. The relation between the files is as described in ppt. So please input the command like 'python main.py 0' for Windows or 'python3 main.py 0' for linux or MacOS.

	3. The file student.py is already done by TA. Since the port is not connected at the beginning, we commented out the part related to it. You may impliment that part after successfully simulating your algorithm. Moreover, since BT.py isn't done, some functions may not work yet. You may also modify this file based on different design for BT.py .

	4. The file score.py is also done by TA. You may impliment the functions of it as you want, just make sure you correctly understand the using of it. (It's ideas are trivial, I hope you would also think so.)

	5. You are encouraged to impliment your ideas instead of using ours. Actually, our design is just a simple baseline. We believe you can design better algorithm and data structures :)

	6. Feel free to ask TA by email, but please don't message us, we would ignore direct message. 

Best,
TAs
